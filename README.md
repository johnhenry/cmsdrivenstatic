My remarkable Nuxt.js project

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```

For detailed explanation on how this work, check out [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).

Ensure that there is a chain of <nuxt-link>s from your static pages to dynamically generated pages. This ensures that Nuxt generates them, I think?
